## List of messages for KitMaster to draw on when performing kit operations.  Use chat codes with the ampersand ('&').
##
## IMPORTANT: YAML is OCD about characters.  If you want to start a line with a macro (like %kit% or %player%), you
## MUST bookend the line with single quotes.  If you do this, any single quote within the line must become TWO single
## quotes (not a double quote).
